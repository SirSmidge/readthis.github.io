### About
read.this() is an all-in-one book club app. The main features are having an easy to use calendar to schedule your book club meetups, along with convenient searches from the New York Times bestsellers list and Open Library for access to all published works for inspiration for your club themes. 

### Motivation
Traditionally, book clubs have been non-formal and consist of a a few friends who want to read the same book. We wanted to give users the option of meeting up with a group of local enthusiasts to expand their social circle as well as their literary horizons. 

### Result
With the utilization of Open Library and The New York Times APIs, as well as the Full Calendar Javascript plugin, and a Materialize-flavored version of Bootstrap 4, we were able to build an app that is aesthetically pleasing, and allows you to schedule meets as well as discover new books that your group might be interested in. 

### Challenges and Future Implementations
Working with Google APIs for OAuth, Maps, Calendar, and Chat.
