                            Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit (a mythological creature invented by Tolkien) who lives in a large
                            and comfortable hobbit-hole. The book opens with a brief description of hobbits, given in
                            the clever tones of the omniscient narrator, who often speaks directly to the reader.
                            Hobbits are peaceful rural creatures, about half the height of humans, with leathery feet
                            and hairy toes, who tend to be stout because of their fondness for eating well and often.
                            Bilbo Baggins is a wealthy hobbit who lives alone. On the Baggins side, his family has
                            always been very quiet and respectable; however, his mother was a Took and, as the narrator
                            tells us, the Tooks tended to be adventurous hobbits. Bilbo has a little of both in his
                            personality.
                            <br><br>
                            On a bright spring morning, Bilbo is enjoying a pipe in front of his hobbit-hole when the
                            wizard Gandalf comes by. Gandalf asks Bilbo if he would like to sign up for an adventure,
                            and Bilbo declines. Not wanting to seem rude, though, Bilbo invites Gandalf to join him for
                            tea the following afternoon. The next day at tea time, 13 dwarves show up in addition to
                            Gandalf. The flustered Bilbo receives everyone with polite hospitality, eventually realizing
                            that Gandalf has brought them all together because he believes that Bilbo should join their
                            adventure. The dwarves intend to reclaim their stolen ancestral treasure from the terrifying
                            dragon Smaug, who long ago drove the dwarves from their land and now sits hoarding their
                            riches atop the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf has told the dwarves that Bilbo is a burglar, which
                            Bilbo most certainly is not. When Bilbo overhears the dwarves expressing their doubts about
                            his ability to aid in their quest, Bilboâ€™s pride takes over and he insists on joining in the
                            adventure.
                            <br><br>
                            The next morning, the dwarves leave before Bilbo is out of bed. Discovering his hobbit-hole
                            empty, Bilbo is relieved to escape the long journey and frightening adventure. Gandalf soon
                            shows up, however, and rushes Bilbo out the door, explaining that the dwarves expect to meet
                            him at the inn where they have gone ahead to arrange food and...
